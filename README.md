## COLA Data


### Multi-objects setting
The `data/cleaned_hardcontrastive_val_unique.json` conatins the multi-objects settign data. 

The json file contains data like:
`[link to image 1, caption 1, link to image 2, caption 2, ignore]`

The image links are in the format: https://cs-people.bu.edu/array/data/vg_gqa_images/2414605.jpg. The 2414605 is the visual genome id.

The image 1 and image 2 have attributes and objects that are swapped in the captions.

Caption 1 applies to image 1 and not image 2 and vice versa. 

### Single Objects setting
More information will be posted soon.
